<meta name="description" content="This is my second post in this blog. Here I’ll try to share some perceptions about Jekyll. I’ve developing in Jekyll since decided to wrote a Business Card and a simple blog to share some ideas and thougths. So, you asked me: “What’s Jekyll?” Let me resume: Jekyll it’s a static website generator based in Markdown and Ruby to build a simple website. This is the default engine used in GitHub Pages. You can use CSS and HTML to build a template, some JS where you want and build some static files to upload into a GitHub Pages enabled repository. As you can use CSS, some modifications are simple: you can change fonts with Google Fonts, for example. This website it’s using Muli and Bree Serif at the time of this post The social links used in the blue bar it’s based on HTML/CSS and variables from _config.yml file of Jekyll application. You can read Jekyll Documentation to learn more about. And “How to write posts?” The process about writing posts it’s very simple. Jekyll provide a folder called _posts to keep your source files, based on Markdown - this files contains text and formatting of your posts. The post file has a pattern for name: it’s based on the title and date time, as YYYY-MM-DD-my-post-title.md. The file used to generate this post was named as 2019-06-07-perceptions-about-jekyll.md. That last part will be used as URL of the post. All formatting of post are based on Markdown. Bold used with **bold text**, Italic with *italic text* and titles with #. I can even make a small list of links at end of file to make easier link maintenance." />

    <p>This is my second post in this blog. Here I’ll try to share some perceptions about <a href="jekyll_homepage">Jekyll</a>. I’ve developing in Jekyll since decided to wrote a <strong>Business Card</strong> and a simple blog to share some ideas and thougths.</p>

<h4 id="so-you-asked-me-whats-jekyll">So, you asked me: “What’s Jekyll?”</h4>

<p>The social links used in the blue bar it’s based on HTML/CSS and variables from <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file of Jekyll application. You can read <a href="jekyll_docs">Jekyll Documentation</a> to learn more about.</p>

<h4 id="and-how-to-write-posts">And “How to write posts?”</h4>

<p>The process about writing posts it’s very simple. Jekyll provide a folder called <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> to keep your source files, based on <strong>Markdown</strong> - this files contains text and formatting of your posts.</p>

<p>All formatting of post are based on Markdown. <strong>Bold</strong> used with <code class="highlighter-rouge">**bold text**</code>, <em>Italic</em> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">*italic text*</code> and titles with <code class="highlighter-rouge">#</code>. I can even make a small list of links at end of file to make easier link maintenance.</p>
