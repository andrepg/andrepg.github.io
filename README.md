This is my main website, my personal hub and my personal blog. It's built with Vite and VueJS, powered by Vite Markdown and PrismsJS.

## 🤖 Recommended IDE Setup

To build or explore this app, I recommend some configurations, they are the following:

- Use the VSCode Workspace file to open the project and use the recommended plugins
